# 🛠️ JavaScript Product Management System

This **JavaScript** product management system allows users to perform **CRUDS** (Create, Read, Update, Delete, Search) operations using **JavaScript** and **localStorage**.

## 📋 Features

- **Create (C):** Add new products and save them to local storage.
- **Read (R):** View newly added products as well as existing products stored in local storage, displayed in a table format.
- **Update (U):** Edit any product's details directly in the table.
- **Delete (D):** Remove any product from the table.
- **Search (S):** Find products by title or category.

## 🚀 How It Works

1. **Create Product:** Enter product details and save them. The product will be added to the local storage and displayed in the table.
2. **Read Products:** All products saved in local storage are retrieved and shown in a table format.
3. **Update Product:** Modify product details and update them in both the table and local storage.
4. **Delete Product:** Select and remove a product from the table and local storage.
5. **Search Products:** Use the search functionality to find products based on their title or category.
